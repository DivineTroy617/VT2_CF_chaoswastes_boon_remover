[/list]

What is removed for zealot only:
[list]
[*] Shallya's Rejuvenation - Regenerate 1 health every 3 seconds.
[*] Natural Bond - you know what this is: regen 1 health every 5s, healing items only restore temporary health on self.
[*] Ualapt's Cunning - Picking up ammunition grants 15 health.
[*] Hand of Shallya - Healing an ally with Medical Supplies also heals you for 50% of your missing health.
[*] Decanter - You know what this is.*
[*] Grenadier*
[*] Explosive Ordinance*
[*] Shrapnel*
[*] Sigmar's Comet - Throwing a bomb throws one additional bomb (of the same type).*
[*] Atharti's Malice - Damaging enemies with damage over time effects grants 0.25 health.
[*] Ereth Khial's Pride - Gain 100 % Power and rapid health regeneration for 10 seconds when all your allies are downed. 
[*] Grimnir's Implacabilitiy - Falling below 10% health grants you 15% attack speed and movement speed and prevents incoming damage for 10 seconds. **
[*] Font of Zeal - Healing yourself with a First Aid Kit or a Healing Draught also heals your nearby allies for 20% of their maximum health. Removes any Wounds.
[*] Devotion - Taking damage increases movement speed by 30% for 2 seconds. Getting attacked no longer slows movement speed.
[*] Smite - Every 5 hits grants a guaranteed critical strike. Critical strikes can no longer occur randomly.*
[/list]
* Friend told me to remove them. Some of these grenaid boons and career skills are good imo, but he doesn't agree. This is a very opinionated pick.
**  Grimnir's Implacabilitiy is theoretically really good but the last I checked, it bugs out with zealot's own death invuln and outright kills the zealot.

What is removed for battle wizard only: 
[list]
[*] Lingering Flames - Siennas burning effects now last until the affected enemy dies. Burning effects does not stack
[*] Rechannel - When Tranquillity is active, Siennaâ€™s ranged charge time is reduced by 40%.
[/list]

What is removed for pyromancer only:
[list]
[*] Exhaust - Ult removes overcharge, pyro in chaos wastes want high charge for crit boon synergy. Getting this out of a random boon chest will immediately break build.
[/list]

overwrites DeusPowerUpExclusionList, not compatible with other mods that change the table.
